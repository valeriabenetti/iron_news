# Iron News
## The Iron Yard Week 4 Day 4 Weekend Homework

One of the basic, foundational news portals for professional web developers is Hacker News which is kind of like a Reddit for the startup/design/development community with a very... minimalist design ethic.

This weekend's lab is to build our own Iron News!

### Objectives

Bring together all we have recently learned:
 1. Bootstrap
 2. Forms
 3. ActiveRecord + databases for storing data
 4. Classes, blocks, enumerable
 5. ERB
Practice building a full app!
